Problem to be Solved
---

The use of URLs to access websites has always been a hassle, as they are sometimes long, or with words that are hard to type. When a user types a URL, there is a high chance of having a ‘'typo', which refers to small mistakes users can make when typing on a keyboard. These inoffensive mistakes can actually be the door for a dangerous security breach. Just one wrong character could send you to a look-alike site that can steal sensitive information, install malware, or even lock up your computer. 


## Argumentation

A QR code is today a practical way to share information, this allows us to be faster and more agile to achieve it. That is why a tool that has a web interface without the need for a command line.

## Solution

We propose a program that will be used in web app format to be able to view it on a cell phone or computer where you can generate secure QR codes.

We will also add a button to share it quickly.

## Technologies / Stack

- Base language: Elixir
- Use of Phoenix framework: Elixir
- Use of React: JavaScript

## Requirements

```Elixir v1.0.2+```

[Install Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Scopes

1) The user enters the link to the interface
2) The link will be transformed into a shortcut by the program
3) The program will create the QR code 
4) User can decide to share the code (Optional)
